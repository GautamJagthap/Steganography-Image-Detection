# 🕵️‍♀️ Steganography Image Detection – Research Internship Project

This repository tracks the research and development progress of our internship project focused on detecting hidden information in images using machine learning and deep learning methods.

## 📌 Project Overview

Steganography is the practice of concealing messages or information within digital media. This research aims to detect and classify such hidden content in images using advanced machine learning models. The project is part of an ongoing internship under the guidance of the [Your Organization/Institution Name].
